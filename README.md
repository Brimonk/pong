# Literally Terminal Pong

I got bored, and I decided to write pong.

### 'Installation'

I do **NOT** feel that it's necessary to include an installation option within
the `Makefile`; therefore, you can simply type `make` and if you have ncurses
installed with a C compiler, the program will compile everything, and spit out
a binary: `pong`.

### How To Play

#### Rules

It's pong. C'mon.


#### **Controls**

* j - down
* k - up
* p - pause
* q - quit
